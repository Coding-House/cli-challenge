Whoa!

That password just dropped the rude gatekeeper into that large sinkhole. And out popped a weird plant. What happened?

We used the move (mv) command!

The move command is used like this:

mv <file_to_move> <place_to_move_it_to>

So we moved the gatekeeper to the large-sinkhole directory, and the weird plant to the current working directory.

Forgot what you just typed? Use the up and down arrows to scroll through recently used commands.


Now, about this plant. We should probably take care of it. Let's make a garden!

First, make a new directory called "beautiful-garden". Use the mkdir command like this:


mkdir beautiful-garden


Next add some water using the touch command to create a new file called 'water' like this:


touch water


Finally, use the move command to put the weird plant and water in the beautiful garden.




Ahh... another job well done!

Hold on, weren't we searching for the white rabbit? Maybe the crumpled note has another CLUE...
