A gatekeeper stands steadfastly in your way.

When you try to pass, he snarls menacingly and gestures rudely. You interpret this as meaning you need a password to continue.

Bummer...

There seems to be some gibberish on that crumpled note. It probably has the password, but who has time to read through all that?

Oh wait! We can use Global Regular Expression Print (grep) command.

Use grep like this:

cat <file_to_read> | grep <expression_to_search_for>

That line in the middle is read 'pipe'. It takes the output of the left-hand side (the cat) and "pipes" it into the right-hand side (our grep filter).

Try to grep for password
