Hello there! Glad you could join me on this little excursion around the CLI.

We've got a lot to learn, so let's get to it!

First, let's get comfortable navigating around. See that directory there, the-rabbit-hole?

My friend, the White Rabbit, was late! Late to a very important date and had to leave. Can you find him and tell him I'll call him later?

Thanks!

P.S. - Tab complete is your friend! Use the tab key to auto-complete your typing. It saves your wrists AND prevents typing errors!
